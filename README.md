<!--
**JeremyNash-hub/JeremyNash-hub** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a python program that mines data from XML files containing info about satellite constellations.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to write better code in python
- âš¡ Fun fact: I like to snowboard!
